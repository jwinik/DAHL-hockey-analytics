Github Repository for DAHL Fantasy Hockey Analytics

There are currently two types of PDFs I put together last season: 
	1. Overall team stats (ex: Week 13)
	2. Player stats (ex: Week 6)

For the 2021 - 2022 Season, I will be using the ESPN API to pull in weekly rosters and player point totals.

If possible I want to scrape the weekly ESPN rosters so that we don't have to copy them in ourselves.
